C++ Challenges for Discord Members (Rank E to S+)
Here’s a set of fun C++ challenges, ranked from E (super easy) to S+ (tricky but doable). Each task is straightforward but requires careful coding to avoid mistakes. They use basic C++ concepts up to while loops. Jump in and enjoy!

Rank E: Sum of Numbers
Task: Write a C++ program that takes a number n (between 1 and 100) and adds up all integers from 1 to n. Print the total.
Example Input/Output:

Input: 5
Output: 15 (because 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15)
Input: 3
Output: 6 (because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6)

Hint: Use a for loop to add numbers one by one.

Rank D: Count the Vowels
Task: Write a C++ program that reads a string (up to 100 characters) and counts how many vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', in any case) are in it. Print the count.
Example Input/Output:

Input: Hello
Output: 2 (counts 'e' and 'o')
Input: APPLE
Output: 2 (counts 'A' and 'E')

Hint: Check each character and handle both uppercase and lowercase vowels.

Rank C: Flip the Number
Task: Write a C++ program that takes a number (between 1 and 10000) and reverses its digits. Print the reversed number.
Example Input/Output:

Input: 123
Output: 321
Input: 1000
Output: 1 (not 0001)

Hint: Use modulo (%) and division (/) to get and rebuild digits.

Rank B: Fibonacci Sequence
Task: Write a C++ program that takes a number n (between 1 and 1000) and prints all Fibonacci numbers (starting with 0, 1) up to n. Print them on one line, separated by spaces.
Example Input/Output:

Input: 10
Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
Input: 1
Output: 0 1 1

Hint: Use a while loop to generate Fibonacci numbers until you pass n.

Rank A: Is It a Palindrome?
Task: Write a C++ program that takes a string (up to 100 lowercase letters, no spaces) and checks if it’s a palindrome (reads the same backward and forward). Print "Yes" if it is, or "No" if it isn’t. Use a while loop to check.
Example Input/Output:

Input: radar
Output: Yes
Input: hello
Output: No

Hint: Compare characters from the start and end, moving inward with a while loop.

Rank S+: Triangle Pattern
Task: Write a C++ program that takes a number n (between 1 and 20) and prints a triangle with n rows. Each row i has i positions, but only odd-numbered positions (1, 3, etc.) get an asterisk (*); even positions get a space.
Example Input/Output:

Input: 4
Output:

*   
* * 
*   * 
* * * 


Input: 3
Output:

*   
* * 
*   * 

Hint: Use nested while loops for rows and columns, and check if the position is odd.
